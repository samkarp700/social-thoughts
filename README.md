# Social Media App - Thoughts and Reactions

## Description
This application was created using MongoDB and Express.js. In this project, I crated an API for a social network application where users can create a friend list, post their thoughts and react to other user thoughts. 

## Built With
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- Express.js
- Node.js

## Installation
1. First, git clone the repository. 
2. Install Node.js and MongoDB on your local computer. 
3. Install all dependencies by typing 'NPM Install' in your command line in the terminal. 

## Usage
Launch this application by running 'NPM Start' in the command line of your terminal. 
Using an application like Insomnia, begin a new HTTP request by entering localhost:3005/api/<insert endpoint>. 
You can replace the <insert endpoint> with endpoints like "users" or "thoughts" to get the data from the MongoDB. 

On [Youtube](https://youtu.be/1qoW1ygK76M), I posted a video walkthrough showcasing my example of the social media application being used by characters from a favorite show: The Office!
